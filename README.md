# GWAS SumStats Tools
___

GWAS SumStats Tools is a versatile toolkit created to simplify the processing, validation, and formatting of GWAS summary statistics files intended for submission to the GWAS catalog. This toolkit provides a variety of features designed for efficiency and ease of use.

## Features
1. Reading: Preview a GWAS summary statistics data file, extract headers, metadata, or specific field-value pairs from the metadata.
2. Formatting: Convert tubular sumstats files to GWAS catalog standard format (gwas-ssf), with options for spliting fields, renaming fields, reordering, convert -log (P-value) to normal P-values, handling missing values efficiently and removing comments.
3. Metadata Generation: Automatically generate metadata for a data file from a submission form or create metadata from the GWAS Catalog (for internal use).
4. Validation: Validate the integrity of a summary statistic file using a dynamically generated schema.

## Quick Start
