# GWAS SumStats Tools
___

GWAS SumStats Tools is a versatile toolkit created to simplify the processing, validation, and formatting of GWAS summary statistics files intended for submission to the GWAS catalog. This toolkit provides a variety of features designed for efficiency and ease of use.

## Features
1. Reading: Preview a GWAS summary statistics data file, extract headers, metadata, or specific field-value pairs from the metadata.
2. Formatting: Convert tabular sumstats files to GWAS Catalog standard format (gwas-ssf), with options for splitting fields, renaming fields, reordering, converting -log (P-value) to normal P-values, handling missing values efficiently and removing comments.
3. Metadata Generation: Automatically generate metadata for a data file from a submission form or create metadata from the GWAS Catalog (for internal use).
4. Validation: Validate the integrity of a summary statistic file using a dynamically generated schema.

## Quick Start

### User-friendly Interface:SSF-morph

### Command Line Interface
However, if you require full access to all functions, or if you need to process larger files or multiple files simultaneously, we recommend using the command-line interface. Please follow the instructions provided here to install and use the command-line tools.
